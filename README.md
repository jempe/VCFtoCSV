# VCF to CSV

This program is designed to convert a vcf (vCard) file to a csv (Comma Separated Values) file. The vcf file is a commonly used format for storing contact information, while the csv file is a widely supported format for data storage and exchange.

The program is written in Swift, and uses regular expressions to extract relevant information from the vcf file. It then stores the extracted information in a mutable array, which is finally converted into a csv string and saved to a file.

The program is easy to use and highly customizable. You can specify the input and output file paths, and modify the regular expressions to match the specific format of your vcf file.
